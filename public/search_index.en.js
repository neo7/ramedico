The final content of the file should look similar\nto this:\n\n\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page, click \"Commit changes\" button.\n\n\nOnce the rebuild finishes, your feed will be available at https://&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo&gt;\n\n\nLocalhost\n\n\nClone the NotFeed-Template repository.\n\n\nEdit Config.toml file.\n\n\nRun notfeed\n\nbuild: notfeed build\nserve: notfeed serve --addr 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 or simply notfeed serve\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nInspired by osmos::feed\n\n","id":"https://ramedico.in/projects/notfeed-a-rss-reader-on-github/","title":"NotFeed: A RSS Reader on GitHub"},"https://ramedico.in/projects/resume-a-zola-theme/":{"body":"Zola Resume\n快速开始\n\n此方法之后更新主题可能比较麻烦\n安装\n第一步: 初始化网站\n\nStep 2: 安装 zola-resume\n安装该主题到themes目录:\n\n或者使用 submodule 安装:\n\nStep 3: 配置网站\n在配置文件中 config.toml 开启本主题:\n\n或者直接复制 config.toml.example 到本目录:\n\nStep 4: 添加/修改内容\n然后复制:\n\n你可以修改或者添加新内容到 content/blog, content/projects 等目录，注意其中的 _index.md 不要删除。\nStep 5: 运行项目\n使用如下命令查看效果:\n\n打开 http://127.0.0.1:1111 查看效果。\nStep 6: 自动构建\n复制 github actions 配置文件：\n\n配置 CMS 系统\nStep 1: 修改配置文件\n复制 cms 配置文件:\n\n并修改如下部分:\n\n配置后台认证\n首先到 Netlify 注册账号并配置仓库，这个时候会自动构建失败，不用管它。\n进入网站 setting 的 Build &amp; deploy 选项把 Build settings 的 active 关掉，这样就不会消耗 netlify 的自动构建时长。\n进入 setting 的 Access control 找到其中的 OAuth，Install provider 把 Github 装上。其中的 github app 可以查看这个文档进行配置。\n最后在 setting 的 Custom domains 里面添加 YOURNAME.github.io，会有警告，但是不用管他，前面有一个 Default subdomain，把他记下来填到 static/admin/config.yml 里面的 backend.site_domain 里面去。\nAbout 主页\n修改 contents/_index.md 来改变主页内容\n其他文件\n\ndata/certifications.json\ndata/social.json\ndata/skills.json\ndata/experience.json\ndata/education.json\n\n","id":"https://ramedico.in/projects/resume-a-zola-theme/","title":"Resume: a zola theme"},"https://ramedico.in/publications/":{"body":"Something\nA collection of articles, presentations or talks, most likely on NLP\n","id":"https://ramedico.in/publications/","title":"Publications"},"https://ramedico.in/publications/hit-scir-at-mrp-2020-transition-based-parser-and-iterative-inference-parser/":{"body":"This paper describes our submission system (HIT-SCIR) for the CoNLL 2020 shared task: Cross-Framework and Cross-Lingual Meaning Representation Parsing.\nThe task includes five frameworks for graph-based meaning representations, i.e., UCCA, EDS, PTG, AMR, and DRG.\nOur solution consists of two sub-systems:\n\ntransition-based parser for Flavor (1) frameworks (UCCA, EDS, PTG)\niterative inference parser for Flavor (2) frameworks (DRG, AMR).\n\nIn the final evaluation, our system is ranked 3rd among the seven team both in Cross-Framework Track and Cross-Lingual Track, with the macro-averaged MRP F1 score of 0.81/0.69.\n","id":"https://ramedico.in/publications/hit-scir-at-mrp-2020-transition-based-parser-and-iterative-inference-parser/","title":"HIT-SCIR at MRP 2020: Transition-based Parser and Iterative Inference Parser"},"https://ramedico.in/publications/n-ltp-a-open-source-neural-chinese-language-technology-platform-with-pretrained-models/":{"body":"An open-source neural language technology platform supporting six fundamental Chinese NLP tasks:\n\nlexical analysis (Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition)\nsyntactic parsing (dependency parsing)\nsemantic parsing (semantic dependency parsing and semantic role labeling).\n\nUnlike the existing state-of-the-art toolkits, such as Stanza, that adopt an independent model for each task, N-LTP adopts the multi-task framework by using a shared pre-trained model, which has the advantage of capturing the shared knowledge across relevant Chinese tasks.\nIn addition, knowledge distillation where the single-task model teaches the multi-task model is further introduced to encourage the multi-task model to surpass its single-task teacher.\nFinally, we provide a collection of easy-to-use APIs and a visualization tool to make users easier to use and view the processing results directly.
